            <br />
            In case of any dissatisfaction from any design services provided by
            9solutions.co, you can submit a refund request within 48 hours of
            your initial designs completion. However, it shall be assumed
            between both parties that you are satisfied with your initial
            designs if a refund request is not received within 48 hours of
            initial designs delivery. For any Special / Combo packages, refund
            will be applicable the same as it is on the single packages.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If refund request is made after 48 hours of initial design samples
              delivery, then it won’t be eligible for any refund. It will be
              assumed that the customer is satisfied with design samples
              provided.
            </li>
            <li>

            responsibility to check the account area to address any queries,
            concerns, or additional instructions required by the designer. Not
            checking or using the Account Area frequently shall not provide you
            adequate grounds for a refund. However, if you are uncertain how to
            use the area, you may contact the customer support team at any time
            for assistance.

            our services are targeted towards providing maximum satisfaction to
            our clients. For each design that we create, a thorough research is
            being undertaken to ensure quality and uniqueness in your design. We
            never embark on your any job without prior researching. Your
            satisfaction is the magic word that motivates us to do better. Thus,
            whatever we do is targeted in the direction of your satisfaction.
            Our designers, while working on your job, ensure that the design
            they create for you should comply with the specifications you have
            provided in your order form. 9solutions.co aims at providing its

          <p>
            We have always maintained satisfaction of our clients as our first
            priority. When you return to us with your design for amendment, our
            design team takes it as a challenge. We work according to the
            specifications until you are 100% satisfied with the results. We
            modify your design until you find it absolutely the way you want it
            to be. In case, you require us to coordinate with your printing
            company we will do that as well. For your convenience, we also offer
            complete coordination with your printing company for free.
